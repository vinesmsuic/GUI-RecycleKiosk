# Recycle Kiosk Project for School Assignment 
(Java on Netbeans IDE)

## Aims
```
1. To encourage recycling in our community, residents who deposit the below material / items to the recycling kiosk will gain credits to their Octopus Card as scheduled below (items and prices here are for reference only, you need to research and define them):
a. Tin cans, e.g. HK$0.3 / unit
b. Card boards, e.g. $5 / kg
c. Plastic bottle, e.g. $0.5 / unit
2. An user-friendly, GUI-based kiosk system will be designed to facilitate automatic tabulation of the credit amount and print out receipts for the depositors.
3. At the end of every working day, the recycling kiosk will generate a report summarizing quantities of every categorized item
```
